Copying others people work and claiming it as your own is a serious breach of ethics. If
copied work is found, all parties involved will receive a failing grade as per
departmental policy. Group work is encouraged but it is expected that you do your own
work. If you do, you'll learn the material and feel better for it. Since all work submitted is
assumed to be your own original work, you must include the following "Statement of
Authorship":
"StAuth10244: I Alen Varghese Cheruvally Kunjumon, 000837873 certify that this material is my original work.
No other person's work has been used without due acknowledgement. I have not made my work available to anyone else."
